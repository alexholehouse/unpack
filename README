unpack
=============

A simple tool to make unpacking your compressed files simpler!

Overview
-------
Super simple script which unifies your unpacking needs into a single command. Don't you
hate having to look up the combination of flags and inputs to unpack that file? Never fear,
simply input a compressed file into unpack, and an unpacked copy is created. The original
file isn't altered, so if it goes wrong your data is still safe.

To make it work from commandline anywhere, download, then add it's location to your 
$PATH variable, or add an alias to the script in .*rc. This [link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6637622/how-can-i-run-perl-script-from-anywhere-in-unix-environment) might help.

how the file was originally compressed.
